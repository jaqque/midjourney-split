# Midjourney Splitter

## Clone

I assume you know how to do this.

```shell
git clone <uri>
```

## Build

Build the container

```shell
./build.sh
```

## Run

Run the conversion

```shell
./runme <uri to midjourney image to split>
```

Output is in the `out` directory, filename is returned to STDOUT
